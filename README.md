## Development Stack

The Wanderable site is built using:

- [Rails (3.1.3)](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
> Ruby on Rails is a full-stack web framework optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It encourages beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration.

- [LESS (1.7.0)](http://lesscss.org/) via the [less-rails gem](https://github.com/metaskills/less-rails) 
> A *gem* is a Ruby software package that provides external functionalities to an existing Rails project. 
> Less is a CSS-preprocessor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. 

- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) via the [coffee-rails gem](https://github.com/rails/coffee-rails)
> CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way. 

- [Bootstrap (3.1.1)](http://getbootstrap.com/)
> The most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via the [jQuery-rails gem](https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails)
> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

Although the app does not rely solely on these technologies, a good grasp of them is enough for basic development on Wanderable's frontend.

### Wanderable's Asset Pipeline

> The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages and pre-processors such as CoffeeScript, Sass and ERB.

The [Rails Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) is a crucial step in our development workflow. Below is a brief summary of pipeline functionality followed by a guide to Wanderable-specific pipeline behaviour. **Note:** The official Rails guide provides a much richer explanation and should be read for full understanding of the pipeline. 

#### Asset Precompilation: Concatenation and Minification 

> The first feature of the pipeline is to concatenate assets, which can reduce the number of requests that a browser makes to render a web page. Web browsers are limited in the number of requests that they can make in parallel, so fewer requests can mean faster loading for your application.

> The second feature of the asset pipeline is asset minification or compression. [...]

Through the Asset Pipeline, Sprockets (a Ruby library) concatenates and minifies all specified CoffeeScript/JS files into one master `.js` file, and all Less files into one master `.css` file. This process is called asset precompilation.

Wanderable's full asset precompilation is done automatically through Heroku when deploying a new version of the app to a Heroku server.

##### Development

On a local development server, assets are not concatenated or minified for the sake of debugging. However, this means that the local server makes *many* requests on page load for every single file included in the precompile path. This can be slow and frustrating, so to disable this functionality and use precompiled files in development, change the following line to false:

    # Expand the lines which load the assets
    config.assets.debug = true 

*Note that this is best done only if the developer is very absolutely not touching any frontend code. Do not commit this for the sake of other developers.*

##### Production 

On Production, the master CSS and JS files are always precompiled. On initial visit, both files are requested from the server and subsequently cached by the browser. These cached files result in a significant decrease in load time throughout the rest of a user's browsing experience on the site, or on return visits. 

Here is an example of the browser requests on initial load of Wanderable's homepage:

> TODO insert image

Now look at the browser requests upon page reload - after the JS and CSS manifests have been cached.

> TODO insert image

Voila! The load request sizes have been significantly reduced. 
*Note: the reduced size is also partly due to image caching through Cloudinary*

#### Asset Precompilation: Less and CoffeeScript

> The third feature of the asset pipeline is it allows coding assets via a higher-level language, with precompilation down to the actual assets.

Wanderable uses the pipeline to allow live compilation of Less and CoffeeScript in development mode. This integration happens through the `less-rails` and `coffee-rails` gems, and do not require extra effort on a developer's part. 

Compiling Less and CoffeeScript through the Asset Pipeline removes the hassle of keeping compiled `.less` to `.css` files and `.coffee` to `.js` files in the repository. It also prevents merge conflicts caused by a difference in compilers, or updated files that did not actually have conflicts, but were compiled to a common file. 

**Note**: Compiling using the pipeline does mean that your local server may be slower to respond, or fail silently if there is a Less or CoffeeScript syntax error. 

#### Using the Asset Pipeline with Wanderable Site Components

Wanderable uses a customized strategy for asset precompilation. Instead of having a master CSS and JS file (called *manifest* files) across the entire site, we split these files by site components. 

A list of Wanderable Site Components:

- Public Site `views/layouts/pubsite_layout.html.erb`
    - For potential users and guests looking for a registry
- Internal Site `views/layouts/application.html.erb`
    - For couples who log in and edit their registries
- Registry Layouts `views/layouts/registry_layout.html.erb`
    - For guests making gift purcahses, or existing users browsing other registries
- Channels `views/layouts/channel.html.erb`
    - For guests referred to us through our white-label hotel partnerships 
- Merchant Portal `views/layouts/merchant_portal.html.erb`
    - For merchants going through our self-serve Merchant Network
- Admin `views/layouts/admin_layout.html.erb`
    - For internal use

Each of these site components have a layout template, CSS manifest file and JS manifest file. 

We implemented separate manifest files for each site component because none of our users typically access every part of the site. 

E.g. a guest visiting a registry to make a gift purchase will not need cached assets for the merchant portal nor internal site - they will never see it. 

Thus, breaking these manifests out by site components saves the user unecessary load time on their site visits. 

For now, we will focus on how we handle asset precompilation for CSS and JS, with Bootstrap, LESS, Coffee and Rails. 

#### Manifest Files 

As mentioned earlier, Wanderable has many separate components that comprise the entire app. This requires us to handle asset loading and caching in a smarter way - for example, it does not make sense to load all of the styles for the public AND internal site if the user is merely a guest landing on a registry page to purchase a gift.

Thus, we allocated separate CSS and JS manifests for each of these components.

> Sprockets uses manifest files to determine which assets to include and serve. These manifest files contain directives - instructions that tell Sprockets which files to require in order to build a single CSS or JavaScript file. With these directives, Sprockets loads the files specified, processes them if necessary, concatenates them into one single file and then compresses them (if Rails.application.config.assets.compress is true). By serving one file rather than many, the load time of pages can be greatly reduced because the browser makes fewer requests. Compression also reduces file size, enabling the browser to download them faster.

Our manifest files are located at `app/assets/stylesheets/*-manifest.css` and `app/assets/javascripts/*-manifest.js`

Setting it up: in `application.rb`, we include the following line of code: 

    config.assets.precompile += %w( *-manifest.css *-manifest.js )

This automatically adds any filepath ending in `-manifest.css` or `-manifest.js` to the precompile path. The original manifests were `application.css` and `application.js`. 

Each manifest file contains [Sprocket directives](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#manifest-files-and-directives), which tell Sprockets which files to concatenate and minify into that specific manifest. 

We then include each compiled manifest into the layout they belong in. 

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'public-manifest' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "public-manifest" %>

A good rule of thumb when in doubt is just to grep for any file including `-manifest`.

#### CSS Manifests

You may notice that all our CSS manifest files only include a single `*-bundle` file, which seems redundant. 

This setup is to allow us to work with LESS. Wanderable relies on Bootstrap heavily, and Bootstrap makes heavy use of mixins, variables and other wonderful LESS features. 

Because manifest files are `.css` files, they are not able to compile from LESS the way we want to. Compiling across files is very important to us in the LESS workflow, to allow us to use the `@import` feature and other fancy things. Thus, our workaround is as such:

- A `*-manifest.css` file that includes only `-bundle` files. This gets precompiled and served to the user
- A `*-bundle.less` file that imports all the necessary LESS files across our assets for the particular site component
    - All newly created LESS files have to be included in their respective bundle through the `@import` function

The `global-bundle.less` is a special bundle that does not belong to any manifest. This is because it stands alone as the set of basic Wanderable styles 
    - bootstrap overrides
    - header styles
    - footer styles
    - type

Separating out the global bundle allows us to keep the bundle files [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) - the bundle can simply be included in other bundles, instead of repeating the `@import` statements over and over again.

We see this behaviour again in the `channel-bundle`, which imports the `internal-bundle`. 

*Note: the bundle/manifest setup works well in separating components, but may still cause repeated code in final compilation. It is up to the developer to decide on a tradeoff between DRY or clean code.*

##### Processing LESS, good practices and current conventions

Currently, *most* LESS files are named with the following format: 

_[filename]-[hyphenate]-[all]-[other]-[words].less 

The underscore was more important pre-less-rails, when we were compiling LESS files manually in our local environments. Underscores signify LESS partials, which we do not want compiled.

However, less-rails and the asset pipeline now handle that without any worry on our end. Our files are currently in a mixed syntax, some with and without prepended `_`, and some hyphenated and some underscored. It would be nice to someday agree on a convention and rename all files to follow it. 

#### Working with Bootstrap

Wanderable uses a heavily customized version of Bootstrap. You can see the exact variable overrides in `app/assets/stylesheets/less/global/bootstrap_overrides/_variables.less`

Note: our customization was done manually, not through the [customizer](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/), and thus is a little messy. It consists of variables which *may not* have originally been defined in Bootstrap's `variable.less`. *Nice to have: cleaning up the overrides file*

The Bootstrap CSS components most commonly used on the site are
    - Grid system and responsive utilities 
    - Typography
    - Tables
    - Forms
    - Buttons
    - Helper Classes

#### JS Manifests 

The JS manifest files are a lot more straightforward - they use the Sprocket directives to include either entire directories or specific files from certain directories, which are all commented in each manifest.

*Note the difference between require and require_tree* 
*jQuery and jQueryujs are required through gems*

One point to note is that the JS manifests do have dependencies - certain libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, etc. have to be included at the top of the file before other plugins that use it. 

`ie-manifest` is a special manifest created to handle LTIE9 browsers. In those browsers (which Wanderable no longer supports), it triggers an unobstrusive header prompting the user to upgrade their browser.

We have started migrating to use coffee, but 90% of our files are still old JS.

Note: JS manifests are always included at the bottom of the body in a layout, to allow the user to interact with the site without needing to wait for all scripts to be done loading. 

Therefore, any inline page JS should be included like this:

    <% content_for :page_end do %>
        // code here
    <% end %>

However, inline JS is strongly discouraged - the idea is that each page that requires JS should have its own JS file, scoped using its `body-class`. JS file naming conventions: currently we use _ as delimiters, and good practice is to name the JS file the same thing as the view file. This gets confusing if there are two views in different directories with the same name (_form, etc.) so use your discretion and grep accordingly.

We also use [readyselector](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-javascript-include-external.html) to scope our JS. This is done using the 

    <% content_for :body_class do %> page-name page-name-js <% end %>

`.page-name` will usually be used to scope CSS, and `page-name-js` will be used to scope JS like this:
    
    $('.page-name-js').ready(function() {
        // code goes here
    });


We scope all of our CSS and JS to the best of our abilities because one of the drawbacks to concatenation is that every page shares the same JS. Thus, when not properly scoped, broken JS in one file can affect the whole site and break all of the JS. 

This can be seen most commonly when DOM manipulation is happening, e.g.

    var box = $('#box-container'),
        squares = box.find('.squares');

    squares.last().remove();

    // if #box-container does not exist, squares will be undefined and this code will break

#### Responsive

Media queries are used to build responsive sites. 
E.g.
    
    .container {
        width: 1180px;
    }

    @media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) {
        .container {
            width: 800px;
        }
    }

In LESS, both the syntax above and the following syntax is supported: 

    .container {
        width: 1180px;

        @media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) {
            width: 1180px;
        }
    }

At Wanderable, we use the second LESS-only syntax, because it is cleaner to wrap all of the styles related to a selector in its own braces. This also means that the hierachy of styles will be as follows

1. Default styles for a selector
1. Element state styles
1. Pseudo elements, if any
1. Media queries, if any
    - Also include nested styles for element states or pseudo elements at that viewport
1. Nested elements, if any

    .container {
        width: 1180px;

        &:hover {
            color: red;
        }

        &:before,
        &:after {
            content: '/';
            display: block;
        }

        @media @phone {
            width: 800px;

            &:hover {
                color: black;
            }

            &:before,
            &:after {
                display: none;
            }
        }

        .child-container {
            width: 50%;
        }
    }

Wanderable's site is fully responsive, largely relying on [Bootstrap's responsive grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) and responsive utility classes. 

A simple philosophy behind building responsive pages is to keep in mind how the page should look on mobile even when building out the desktop markup. Also, avoid including classes if they are uncessary. Typically, this means writing classes like this:

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3"></div>

or this:

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"></div>

The code above depicts a column of content - when there is more screen estate, the column spans less of the whole page, and increases accordingly according to the viewport. In the second example, we want the column to be 1/3 of the container, for any screen size > `sm`. Thus, we do not include the `md` and `lg` classes.

Bootstrap's responsive philosophy is mobile-first. Unfortunately, we don't really use this at Wanderable - responsive is a feature, but not our priority.  

Currently, our LESS is written desktop-first, and by desktop I mean {768px - 991px}. This is mostly because IE8 does not support media queries, and writing desktop-first LESS will allow default fallbacks to how the site should look in desktop view.

However, after most of the responsive LESS for the public site was written, we decided to drop support for IE8. This grants us the freedom to write media queries in any order we want! 
 

We have a bunch of helper variables built in on top of Bootstrap's media query variables. This was done because their media queries felt clunky and repetitive - and were unintuitive. 

    // TODO: clean this crazy stuff up
    @screen-phone-max: @screen-xs-max;
    @screen-tablet-max: @screen-sm-max;
    @screen-desktop-max: @screen-md-max;

    @phone-v: ~"(max-width: 319px)";
    @phone-h: ~"(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 479px)"; // max-width: 479px
    @phone: ~"(max-width: 479px)"; // max-width: 479px
    @tablet: ~"(min-width: @{screen-xs}) and (max-width: @{screen-xs-max})"; // min-width: 480px, max-width: 767px
    @desktop: ~"(min-width: @{screen-sm}) and (max-width: @{screen-sm-max})"; // min-width: 768px, max-width: 991px
    @desktop-lg: ~"(min-width: @{screen-desktop})"; // min-width: 992px

    @lt-tablet: @phone; // max-width: 479px;
    @lt-desktop: ~"(max-width: @{screen-xs-max})"; // max-width: 767px
    @lt-desktop-lg: ~"(max-width: @{screen-md-max})"; // max-width: 991px

    @desktop-only: ~"(min-width: @{screen-sm})"; // min-width: 768px;

I will be the first to admit that our queries are also cluttered, but they are more straightforward. As you can see, there is a TODO to clean it up.

I also added some responsive utilities in `global/_responsive-utilities.less`. These were basically to handle the `@phone-v` cases which bootstrap does not support.

Basically, the queries I added just simplifies Bootstrap's syntax and adds a layer of meaning (phone, tablet, etc.) to the queries. 

For example, Wanderable's media query:
    
    @media @tablet {
        // responsive code here
    }

Bootstrap's version:

    @media (min-width: @screen-xs) and (max-width: @screen-sm-max) {
        // responsive code here
    }

One caveat is this: media queries operate by inheritance, the same as any other CSS rule.

So this means that 
    
    @media @lt-desktop { // phone and tablet
        color: red;
    }

    @media @phone {
        color: blue;
    }

The color will be blue when the viewport is phone small. This is despite @lt-desktop encompassing both phone and tablet.

    @media @phone {
        color: blue;
    }

    @media @lt-desktop { // phone and tablet
        color: red;
    }

Colour will always be red, because red overwrites blue.

The right way: 

    @media @phone {
        color: blue;
    }

    @media @tablet {
        color: red;
    }

Different colors :) 

One more thing: @grid-breakpoint is a bootstrap variable used for the responsive nav, it is manually defined and should be changed accordingly if needed.

##### Doing responsive with Cloudinary 

Look at `global/_responsive-img-mixins.less`.

Basically, wrote a bunch of mixins to tie in with Cloudinary's API so that LESS compiles responsive images for us automatically.

Also made use of Cloudinary's image processing for the public site.

Else, responsive images are usually done like this 

    .hero-unit {
        background-image: url('image-url.png');
        background-size: cover;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;

        @media @phone { background-image: url('image-url-phone.png'); }
        @media @tablet { background-image: url('image-url-tablet.png'); }
    }

Yes, it's very tedious.

The reason this works is because background images are then loaded conditionally depending on the viewport. 

Background images which aren't supposed to be loaded will then only be loaded when necessary - usually only when the user resizes the window on purpose. 

Cool fact: if an element with a background image is loaded, most modern browsers are also smart enough to not load the background image at all.

Also, this can only be done with background images, not `<img>` tags.

### Additional notes

Here's Wanderable's color palette as defined in `_variables.less`

#### Smooth-scrolling plugin

`global/smooth-scroll.js`
Enables smooth-scrolling to any anchor link on the same page. 

Simply add attribute "data-smoothscroll='true'" to any anchor link to enable smooth scrolling

    <a href="#signup-form" data-smoothscroll="true">Go to signup</a>

#### Parallax image plugin

`global/parallax-scrolling.js`

Simply add class `.parallax-scroll` to any container element with a background image.

This class is used by both CSS and JS.

#### Adding a new page

The workflow for adding a new page is as follows:

In the `.html.erb` file, if it requires any custom CSS or JS, scope it using
    
    <% content_for :body_class %> page-sample page-sample-js <% end %>

Create a CSS file in the corresponding directory (for its component). 

Include the CSS file in the appropriate bundle. 

Create a JS file in the corresponding directory (for its component). It will magically be included on the page and you can check this by viewing all the scripts that are being included on the page in development mode. Remember to scope the JS.

### Workflow/helpful tools

A customized `.gitconfig` file is always a nice-to-have, it allows for color highlighting in diffs, prettier git logs. 

Changing your shell (bash, zsh, fish) also allows you to add cool stuff in your prompt like git branch statuses and the current hash. 

Sublime Text 3 is a great open-source text editor, best feature is fuzzy finding, which allows you to `cmd + p` and search for any filename without needed to autocomplete. It has Vim support in the form of Vintage and Vintageous packages, but note that these packages are still being developed and it does not act exactly like Vim although it tries its best.

CodeKit is a great tool for compiling LESS, Coffee, or any other sort of pre-processed languages. It costs $30 and hasn't been necessary for Wanderable since we started compiling LESS and Coffee through Rails, but it is good to know. It also offers Linting on the fly!
